# General-info 
The idea was to set a simple website with Bootstrap only. I wanted to use as much componens as possible; play a bit with displaying, layouts and different content positioning. The goal was to avoid using CSS which I achieved.

# Technology
* HTML
* Bootstrap v5.3.

# Inspiration & sources

# Status
Completed.

# Conclusions & Issues
Bootstrap components are not fully customizable which causes umbers of issues: 
* Depending on the browser H3 headings may have different font weight.
* Bootstrap icons are not working don't know the reason yet).
* Project got high score on PageSpeed Insights for desktop displays but low for mobiles. Need to be be adjusted. 
* Carousel's "next"nad "prev" buttons doesn't work properly - need to check and replace the whole component if there won't be a chance to fix it. 
* Some of the images doesn't fit well on mid/large displays. Should be adjusted in CSS.
