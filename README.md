# General-info 
The idea was to set a simple website with Bootstrap only. I wanted to use as much componens as possible; play a bit with displaying, layouts and different content positioning. The goal was to avoid using CSS which I achieved.

# Technology
Website built with Bootstrap v5.3. No CSS, no JS.

# Status
Project got high score on PageSpeed Insights for desktop displays but low for mobiles. Need to be be adjusted. Carousel's "next"nad "prev" buttons doesn't work properly - need to check and replace the whole component if there won't be a chance to fix it. Some of the images doesn't fit well on mid/large displays. Should be adjusted in CSS.
